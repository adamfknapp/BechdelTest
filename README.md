# BechdelTest
Visualizing how women are portrayed in film


**Background**: 
The Bechdel test asks a simple question: does a film have at least one scene where two women have a discussion about something other than a man? This repository attempts to visualize how major US films perform against this standard, what those films have in common, and how women's roles in society have chaged in relation to this metric.

**Film Data** 
Film data was compiled from BoxOfficeMojo.com for the top 25 grossing films between 2000 and 2013. For each of these films (1) the gross was normalized to tickets sold based on the inflation rate of film tickets from (http://www.boxofficemojo.com/about/adjuster.htm) (2) Results of the Bechdel test were recorded from https://bechdeltest.com/ and (3) the directors and executive producers were compiled from http://www.imdb.com/ 

**Society Data**
Societal views on Women were compiled from the General Societal Survey, which is availible at http://gss.norc.org/, and from the the percentage of women in the US Congress.
